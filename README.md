# BinarizeBradley
My own implementation of the BinarizeBradley algorithm to convert Color images to Bitonal TIFF. Licensed under The MIT License (MIT).

Why? I've found other Open Source libraries to convert images from Color to B&W, however they're under LGLPv3 License. The MIT License is less restrictive.

The code is based on the paper [Adaptive Thresholding Using the Integral Image](http://people.scs.carleton.ca/~roth/iit-publications-iti/docs/gerh-50002.pdf) by Derek Bradley and Gerhard Roth.
